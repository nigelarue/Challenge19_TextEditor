# Challenge19_TextEditor - J.A.T.E

J.A.T.E is a text editor progressive web app (PWA) that will work in supported browsers for writing JavaScript.

## Installation

Follow the link and press the [install button](https://dry-journey-48231.herokuapp.com/) to install the package manager.

## Usage

Install webpack and webpack-cli as devDependencies in your project:
```md 
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```
Create a webpack configuration file named webpack.config.js in the root directory of your project.

Finally, run the webpack script to bundle your app:
```md
npm run build
```
* Scripts are in the root & client directory's `package.json`.

* `npm run build` script and start the server.

* `cd server nodemon server.js --ignore client` server script changes the current working directory to "server" using the `cd` command and starts the development server using `modemon`, which reloads the server when changes are made to the code, and runs the "server.js" with the `nodemon` command, while `--ignore` starts just the server and ignores the "client" directory even if changes are made.

* `cd client && npm run build` changes the current working directory to "client" using the `cd` command and runs the webpack build script in the client directory.

* `cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i` script changes the current working directory to "server" using the `cd` command and installs the dependencies for the "server" directory with the `npm i` command and then does the same for "client" directory.

* The web application can be installed from the web address provided by Heroku.

* The web application is deployed using Heroku.

## SMU Challenge Provided User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## SMU Challenge Provided Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```
